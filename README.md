# Parallax 2 Polyglot

The project is based on the original
[Parallax-2](http://olofson.net/examples.html) example by David Olofson.
It's a piece of clear and beautiful C, and I hope that my addition of
crude FPS measuring didn't taint it.

I've also made translations to Python and Ruby (for now). They are
intended for raw performance comparison. The next thing to do should be
adding mixed Python/C examples -- with ctypes, the Python/C API and/or
SWIG.

# Running

All programs expect the `tiles.bmp` file to be in the current directory,
therefore you should run them from the project root. The same doesn't
hold for building the examples though.

# Licensing

GPLv3 until somebody proves my assumption that GPLv2 code can be
included into a GPLv3 project.

Yep, I know the licensing info should be speficied in a different way. I
know not how. I'll figure it out though. Someday.
